            PWA stands for Progressive Web App. It's a web app that works
            offline, provides an installable version of the app (and not just a
            shortcut), and can receive push notifications. PWA apps are also
            able to access your camera and microphone, so you'll never be left
            out in the cold when it comes to using them. A key benefit of PWAs
            is that they work with all major browsers including Chrome, Firefox
            and Safari but also other mobile platforms such as Android or iOS
            devices where Google has made its own jump into this market with
            native apps like Gmail which come bundled with PWAs already
            built-in!

            The future of web development is exciting and full of potential. The
            current state of technology allows for a wide range of
            possibilities, including the ability to create sites that are more
            engaging, fast-loading and easy to navigate with just a few taps on
            your smartphone. This is what we have been working towards for
            yearsâ€”and now our efforts are finally paying off! Here's a brief
            look at some different ways you can expect web designers in the near
            future to work:
